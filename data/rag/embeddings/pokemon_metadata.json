        "description": "Blastoise is a Water type Pokémon introduced in Generation 1. Blastoise is a large, bipedal, reptilian Pokémon. It has a blue body with small purple eyes, a light brown belly, and a stubby tail. It has a large brown shell with two powerful water cannons on either side, which can be withdrawn. Blastoise's design is heavily influenced by turtles and tortoises. The cannons likely draw inspiration from the concept of a mobile tank or battleship. Blastoise is notable for being the final evolution stage of one of the original starter Pokémon, along with Venusaur and Charizard. It has a Mega Evolution, available in Generation 6 games and Pokémon Go; it also has a Gigantamax form available in Pokémon Sword/Shield, with an exclusive G-Max move, G-Max Cannonade.",

        "description": "Scizor is a Bug/Steel type Pokémon introduced in Generation 2. Scizor is a red, metallic, ant-like Pokémon with yellow and black patterns on its pincers which resemble an eye pattern. Its body consists of three main parts: the torso, the abdomen and the head. It stands on two legs and has a pair of small wings located on its back which are used to control its body temperature, rather than flying. Scizor's habitat is lush and vast where it can reside with the rest of the swarm. Scizor evolves from the Bug/Flying type Scyther, thus losing its Flying type upon evolution - a rare occurrence for Pokémon. Scizor has a Mega Evolution, available in Generation 6 games and Pokémon Go.",
