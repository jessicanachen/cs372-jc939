# Pokepedai
*Jessica Chen*

Pokepedai is a natural-language Pokémon chatbot that lets players quickly ask questions about Pokémon and get info from locations, weaknesses, and moves.

## What it Does

In Pokémon games, players run into hundreds of different species, each with their own moves, abilities, types, and unique traits. But often, finding information about them, like where a Pokémon appears, what level it learns a certain move, or what types it’s weak against, usually requires searching through dozens of wiki pages and databases. This is time-consuming, frustrating, and breaks the flow of playing the game.

Pokepedai solves this problem by combining this scattered information into a single, easy-to-use source. Instead of manually searching through webpages, players can ask questions in plain language, such as, “Where can I find Bulbasaur?” or “What is Gengar weak to?” Pokepedai interprets these questions and provides clear, accurate answers in one place, making it faster and easier for players to get the info they need and stay focused on enjoying the game.

## Quick Start
