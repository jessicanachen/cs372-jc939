**PokemonScraper**
* The initial template for scraping this code comes from work done from this [repository](https://github.com/christian-jaimes/pokemon-data-scraping). This includes the general setup of the webscraper and most of the code for listing basic pokemon information.
* The boilerplate code for retrieving the rest of the information needed as well as creating the data chunks in generated by ChatGPT, however they are cleaned and commented for methodology purposes afterwards by me.

**RAG Setup**
- The base setup of the rag was copied by a project I made for a different class on terraria: https://github.com/jess-che/terraria-rag/blob/main/discord_bot.py
- hybrid retrieval: https://superlinked.com/vectorhub/articles/optimizing-rag-with-hybrid-search-reranking
